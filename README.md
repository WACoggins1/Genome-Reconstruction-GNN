# Genome-Reconstruction-GNN
The aim of this project is to train a GNN to reconstruct genomes. This repository will be frequently updated as the project advances. 

## The pipeline visualized
[insert visual for pipeline here - need to make it in draw.io]

k-mer optimization (chooses the optimal k value for the dataset) -> sample the dataset -> process into de Bruijn graph -> train and validate the model
